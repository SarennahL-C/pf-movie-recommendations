    "Let’s build a system that will tell you what to watch next based on the similarity of the description of movies.\n",
    "1. Create a code file called movies_task. You may use a .py or .ipynb file.\n",
    "2. Read in the movies.txt file from the code files for this task. Each separate line is a description of a different movie.\n",
    "3. Your task is to create a function to return which movies a user would watch next if they have watched Planet Hulk. The film has the description: “Will he save their world or destroy it? When the Hulk becomes too dangerous for the Earth, the Illuminati trick Hulk into a shuttle and launch him into space to a planet where the Hulk can live in peace. Unfortunately, Hulk lands on the planet Sakaar where he is sold into slavery and trained as a gladiator.”\n",
    "4. The function should take in the description as a parameter and return the title of the most similar movie."
